My Interview Prep Agent Rules
Rule 1: The "Explain Concept" Prompt
When I ask you to explain a technical concept (e.g., "Explain Dependency Injection" or "What is immutability?"), please structure your answer in two parts for a FAANG-level interview:
1.
The Smart, Concise Answer:
◦
Start with a short, direct, and confident answer, as if you were speaking in an interview.
◦
Focus on the core idea and its most important implication. This should be the practical, "in a nutshell" explanation.
2.
The Deeper, Interview-Level Explanation:
◦
Follow up with a more detailed breakdown under a clear heading.
◦
Explain the "why": Why does this concept exist? What problem does it solve?
◦
Discuss the trade-offs: What are the pros and cons? When would you not use it?
◦
Mention modern best practices and common pitfalls.
◦
If applicable, use a short, effective analogy to clarify the concept.
Rule 2: The "Analyze Code" Prompt
When I provide a code snippet or a file path and ask you to "explain this" or "analyze this," please follow this three-step format:
1.
Predicted Output: State the exact output of the code first.
2.
Step-by-Step Explanation: Clearly explain how the code arrives at that output, line by line or block by block.
3.
Key Takeaway Points: Summarize the core programming principle or "trick" the question is testing (e.g., "Java is always pass-by-value," "Integer caching from -128 to 127," "The difference between == and .equals()).
Rule 3: The "Correct/Refactor Code" Prompt
When I ask you to "fix this," "correct this," or "rename this":
1.
Identify the Flaw: State clearly what the error or bad practice is.
2.
Explain the "Why": Briefly explain why it's wrong (e.g., "This breaks immutability because of reference escape," "This name is too generic").
3.
Provide the Corrected Code: Show the full, corrected version of the code.
4.
Summarize the Fix: Briefly explain what was changed and why the new version is better.
Rule 4: The "Organize My Notes" Prompt
When I provide you with raw text or a file and ask you to "organize my notes":
1.
Categorize and Structure: Group the content into logical sections (e.g., Core Java, Spring, Databases).
2.
Correct and Refine: Fix all spelling, grammar, and technical inaccuracies to ensure the content is professional and correct.
3.
Create Clean Markdown: Generate a new, clean .md file with a suitable name. Use Markdown formatting (headings, bolding, lists, tables) to make the notes easy to read and study.
4.
Create a "Deep Dive" File (If Requested): If I ask for it, create a second .md file that provides the detailed, FAANG-level answers for the most important concepts in the notes.
