Cross join in DBMS
Natural and inner join
Checked and unchecked exception in java
Garbage collection in java
Explain Singleton pattern in multi threaded environment. Why double checking lock is required ?
Implement an immutable class that has a hashMap as instance variable
Internal working of a hashmap
How hashcode and equals work. What is its significance. What are the the relative conditione between hashcode and equals eg. If 2 objects are equal there hashcode must be equals but vice versa may not be true.
