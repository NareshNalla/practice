## 1. Assessment Overview

### What is the GHA?
The **Google Hiring Assessment (GHA)** is a behavioral and work-style assessment used to screen candidates. It measures the non-technical skills, traits, and judgment required for success at Google. It is about **cultural fit**, not technical ability.

### Key Facts & Timeline
- ⏰ **Timeline**: You must complete the assessment within **4 days** of receiving the email.
- ⏱️ **Duration**: It typically takes **30-60 minutes** to complete. Do not rush.
- 📊 **Result**: You will usually be notified of the result within **24-48 hours**.
- 🔄 **Retake Policy**: If you fail, you must wait **6 months** to retake it. A passing result is valid for **2 years**.
- 🚫 **Impact**: Failing the GHA makes you ineligible for all Google roles that require it during the waiting period.

### What to Expect (Question Formats)
The assessment contains approximately 50-100 questions, presented in two formats:

#### Type 1: Likert Scale Questions
- **Format**: You rate statements about your work style on a 5-point scale: `Strongly Disagree`, `Disagree`, `Neutral`, `Agree`, `Strongly Agree`.
- **Purpose**: To measure your work-style traits and, most importantly, your **consistency**. Many questions are repeated in slightly different forms to check if you are answering honestly.

#### Type 2: Situational Judgment Questions (SJT)
- **Format**: You are given a realistic work scenario and a list of possible responses.
- **Task**: You must select the **"Most Appropriate"** response and the **"Least Appropriate"** response.
- **Purpose**: To assess your judgment, ethics, and decision-making in a professional context.

## 2. Core Principles & Strategy

### The 8 Pillars of a "Googley" Response
Your answers should consistently reflect these core principles:
1.  ✅ **Ethics & Integrity**: Always do the right thing. Report unethical behavior. Prioritize user privacy.
2.  ✅ **Collaboration & Teamwork**: Work with others, support teammates, and seek input.
3.  ✅ **Communication & Transparency**: Communicate clearly, proactively, and honestly, especially with bad news.
4.  ✅ **User Focus**: Always prioritize the user's needs and experience.
5.  ✅ **Initiative & Problem-Solving**: Proactively identify and solve problems. Don't wait to be told what to do.
6.  ✅ **Adaptability & Handling Ambiguity**: Embrace change and remain productive in uncertain situations.
7.  ✅ **Dependability & Reliability**: Be a reliable teammate who follows through on commitments.
8.  ✅ **Learning & Growth Mindset**: Be open to feedback and willing to admit when you don't know something.

### General Answer Strategy
- **Consistency is Key**: The test intentionally repeats questions to check for honesty. Similar questions must have similar answers. This is the #1 reason people fail.
- **Answer Distribution**: A healthy, realistic profile is not extreme. Aim for a distribution that looks roughly like this:
    - **Strongly Agree**: **15-20%** (Use for your absolute core values: ethics, quality, user focus).
    - **Agree**: **70-75%** (This should be your most common answer for positive traits).
    - **Neutral**: **5-10%** (Use sparingly for things that are genuinely context-dependent).
    - **Disagree/Strongly Disagree**: **~5-10%** (For negative traits you don't have and for attention checks).
