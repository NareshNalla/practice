What are microservies?
Microservices are an architectural approach to developing
software applications as a collection of small, independent
services that communicate with each other over a network.
Instead of building a monolithic application where all the
functionality is tightly integrated into a single codebase,
microservices break down the application into smaller, loosely
coupled services.
-> can be writen in variety of programming languages, and frameworks, each service act as a mini application on its own.
