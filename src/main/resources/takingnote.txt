frontend:
AngularJS: We define a base path and assign a HTML for it now we define routes for the base path and we have controllers for various UI elements.
so instead of getting entire web page only that part is fetched by controller. we can also direclty give like show this view if this is set as true
which means there is a direct binding between view and data. To communicate between controllers we have to define services
